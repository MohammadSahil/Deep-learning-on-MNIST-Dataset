# Deep-learning-on-MNIST-Dataset

MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

MNIST is a popular digit image(28X28 pixels) dataset in which each image is a hand-drawn picture of numeric digits from 0-9
In this repo there are two main categories of models one is based on MLP which takes each pixel as input, Second one is CNN which takes care of locality using convilution of kernels. We can witness the difference in results of both types


Structure of Repository-
    • There are two ipynb notebooks one with MLP another with CNN
    • PDF form is also available
    • First go To MLP then CNN
